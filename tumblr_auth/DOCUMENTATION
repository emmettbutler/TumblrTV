git clone git://github.com/jacobbudin/tumblroauth.git

Or you can download the latest release by visiting:
http://github.com/jacobbudin/tumblroauth/downloads


FLOW OVERVIEW
====================
1) Build TumblrOAuth object using client credentials.
2) Request temporary credentials from Tumblr.
3) Build authorize URL for Tumblr.
4) Redirect user to authorize URL.
5) User authorizes access and returns from Tumblr.
6) Rebuild TumblrOAuth object with client credentials and temporary credentials.
7) Get token credentials from Tumblr.
8) Rebuild TumblrOAuth object with client credentials and token credentials.
9) Query Tumblr API.


TERMINOLOGY
====================
The terminology has changed since 0.1.x to better match the draft-hammer-oauth IETF
RFC. You can read that at http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-hammer-oauth. Some of the
terms will differ from those Tumblr uses as well.

client credentials - Consumer key/secret you get when registering an app with Tumblr.
temporary credentials - Previously known as the request token.
token credentials - Previously known as the access token.


PARAMETERS
====================
There are a number of parameters you can modify after creating a TumblrOAuth object.

Custom useragent:
$connection->useragent = 'Custom useragent string';

Verify TumblrÕs SSL certificate:
$connection->ssl_verifypeer = TRUE;

There are several more you can find in TumblrOAuth.php.



EXTENDED FLOW USING EXAMPLE CODE
====================
To use TumblrOAuth with the Tumblr API you need TumblrOAuth.php, OAuth.php and
client credentials. You can get client credentials by registering your application at
https://Tumblr.com/apps.

The example files are explained below.

0) Users start out on connect.php which displays the "Sign in with Tumblr" image hyperlinked
to redirect.php. This button should be displayed on your homepage in your login section. The
client credentials are saved in config.php as CONSUMER_KEY and CONSUMER_SECRET. You can
save a static callback URL in the app settings page, in the config file or use a dynamic
callback URL later in step 2. In example use http://example.com/callback.php.

1) When a user lands on redirect.php we build a new TumblrOAuth object using the client 
credentials. If you have your own configuration method feel free to use it instead of config.php.
$connection = new TumblrOAuth(CONSUMER_KEY, CONSUMER_SECRET);// Use config.php client credentials
$connection = new TumblrOAuth('abc890', '123xyz');

2) Using the built $connection object you will ask Tumblr for temporary credentials. If you
wish to have a dynamic callback URL for each user you can do pass a URL as a parameter.
$temporary_credentials = $connection->getRequestToken(); // Use applications registered callback.
$temporary_credentials = $connection->getRequestToken('http://example.com/callback.php?');

3) Now that we have temporary credentials the user has to go to Tumblr and authorize the app
to access and updates their data. You can also pass a second parameter of FALSE to not use Sign
in with Tumblr: http://apiwiki.Tumblr.com/Sign-in-with-Tumblr.
$redirect_url = $connection->getAuthorizeURL($temporary_credentials); // Use Sign in with Tumblr
$redirect_url = $connection->getAuthorizeURL($temporary_credentials, FALSE);

4) You will now have a Tumblr URL that you must send the user to. You can add parameters and
they will return with the user in step 5.
https://Tumblr.com/oauth/authenticate?oauth_token=xyz123
https://Tumblr.com/oauth/authenticate?oauth_token=xyz123&info=abc // info will return with user

5) The user is now on Tumblr.com and may have to login. Once authenticated with Tumblr they will
will either have to click on allow/deny, or will be automatically redirected back to the callback.

6) Now that the user has returned to callback.php and allowed access we need to build a new 
TumblrOAuth object using the temporary credentials.
$connection = new TumblrOAuth(CONSUMER_KEY, CONSUMER_SECRET, $_SESSION['oauth_token'], 
$_SESSION['oauth_token_secret']);

7) Now we ask Tumblr for long lasting token credentials. These are specific to the application 
and user and will act like password to make future requests. If a dynamic callback URL was used 
you will also have to pass the oauth_varifier parameter. Normally the token credentials would 
get saved in your database but for this example we are just using sessions.
$token_credentials = $connection->getAccessToken(); // Used applications registered callback URL
$token_credentials = $connection->getAccessToken($_REQUEST['oauth_verifier']);

7a) After getting the token credentials we redirect the user to index.php.

8) With the token credentials we build a new TumblrOAuth object.
$connection = new TumblrOAuth(CONSUMER_KEY, CONSUMER_SECRET, $token_credentials['oauth_token'], 
$token_credentials['oauth_token_secret']);

9) And finally we can make requests authenticated as the user. You can use the built-in authenticate(), read($user, $params), dashboard($params), pages($params), write($params) methods.

$user = $connection->authenticate();
// Load the XML using whichever library you prefer (here, SimpleXML)
$user = simplexml_load_string($user);
$name = (string)$user->tumblelog['name'];
